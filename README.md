# Cloud-Resume-Challenge

This is my code for the Cloud Resume Challenge. What is Cloud Resume Challenge? - The Cloud Resume Challenge is a multiple-step resume project which helps build and demonstrate skills fundamental to pursuing a career in Cloud. The project is based on a book of the same name by Forrest Brazeal.

The AWS services used in this project by me are:
1. AWS S3
2. CloudFront
3. Route 53
4. AWS Lambda
5. DynamoDB

My resume has been coded completely by me using front-end languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I have used Python language to create AWS Lambda functions to communicate with DynamoDB.
